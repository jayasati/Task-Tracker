What are utils? (Simple definition)
Utils = General-purpose helper functions that can be used anywhere in your project.

They are not React components, not API endpoints, and not tied to UI.

Examples include:

Formatting dates
Generating IDs
Converting time (seconds → HH:MM:SS)
Debounce & throttle helpers
Math or text utilities
Fetch wrappers
Validation helpers
